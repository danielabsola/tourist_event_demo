# Data Model Design Decisions and Justification

## Core Structure Design
1. **Geographic Hierarchy**
   - Country -> City -> Venue structure enables regional analysis
   - Supports international expansion and localization
   - Allows for region-specific pricing and offerings

2. **Event Management**
   - Separated Plan and Event entities
   - Plan: represents the template/product (e.g., "Candlelight Concert")
   - Event: specific instances with capacity management
   - Enables better inventory and availability tracking

3. **Category System**
   - Two-level category hierarchy (Category -> CategoryChild) (e.g. Music -> Rock)
   - Flexible classification for different types of experiences
   - Supports detailed analytics and search functionality

## Business Analysis Features

4. **Price Management**
   - Separate Price entity with PriceType enum (SINGLE, MULTIPLE)
   - Currency handling (CurrencyType enum) (USD, EUR, GBP, etc.)
   - Supports multiple pricing tiers and promotions
   - Enables price optimization analysis

5. **User Engagement**
   - User profile with demographics
   - Favorites system for tracking interest
   - Review system for quality control
   - Points system for loyalty program (e.g. 1 point per $1 spent)
   - Points can be redeemed for discounts or other rewards

6. **Status Tracking**
   - StatusType enum across entities (ACTIVE, INACTIVE, SUSPENDED, etc.)
   - Tracks lifecycle of plans, events, and tickets
   - Enables conversion and performance analysis

7. **Capacity Management**
   - Available and occupied capacity tracking
   - Venue type classification (e.g. Stadium, Museum, Theater, etc.)
   - Supports optimization of venue utilization

## Additional Analysis Capabilities

8. **Performance Metrics**
   - Ticket sales analysis (e.g. total tickets sold, revenue, average ticket price)
   - Venue utilization rates (e.g. % of capacity used)
   - Category performance (e.g. % of tickets sold by category)
   - Geographic performance (e.g. % of tickets sold by country)
   - Price point effectiveness (e.g. % of tickets sold at each price point)
